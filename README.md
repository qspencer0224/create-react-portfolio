# Mod 2: Your First React Application & Portfolio Project

### `God is somewhere in the chaos, a portfolio by Quenton Spencer`

## The Approach Taken
Obviously being given a task of creating a portfolio, words like "creativity", "uniqueness", maybe even "professional" come to mind.

Unfortunately for me these words were ringing in my head. Each with their own ideas and approaches to the project which would have me staring at my screen longer than I wanted.

I felt stuck and my ideas felt chaotic.

I just knew I wanted something that represented me and others at the same time. 

I put the styling to the side and focused on the functionality
 
## The Functionality
"Functionality" is something that I'm developing in but  I still have a concept of. React Hooks like <strong>useContext</strong> and <strong>useEffect</strong> been my methods of operation.

## useState
useState was used to pull each project from my github Api

## useEffect
useEffect was used to get the projects from github one-by-one
